# Utility-Scripts

This repository holds several AppleScript automation scripts for quite common and uncommon tasks.

## Transfer Things to Reminders

This AppleScript allows to you choose a project of tasks from Cultured Codes's Things and import them to a Apple Reminder list. Because Apple still does not provide an AppleScript API for Reminder tags, Things tags are added as Text to the task itself.
