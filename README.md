# Utility Scripts

This repository holds several AppleScript automation scripts for quite common and uncommon tasks.

## Transfer Things to Reminders

[This AppleScript](https://github.com/zimmer-partners/Utility-Scripts/blob/master/Transfer%20Things%20to%20Reminders.applescript) allows to you choose a project of tasks from Cultured Codes's Things and import them to a Apple Reminder list. Because Apple still does not provide an AppleScript API for Reminder tags, Things tags are added as Text to the task itself.

## Copy Message Links

[This AppleScript](https://github.com/zimmer-partners/Utility-Scripts/blob/master/Copy%20Message%20Links.applescript) takes the current selected messages from Apple Mail and copies their `message:` URLs to the clipboard. Multiple mails selected end up as a list of URLs separated by new lines.
